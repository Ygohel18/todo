# To-Do App

## Prototype

This To-Do app is a simple task management system that helps you organize and track your tasks effectively. You can categorize tasks, set due dates, prioritize them, and mark them as completed.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Easily create, update, delete, and view tasks.
- **Categories**: Organize tasks into different categories, such as Work, Personal, and Shopping.
- **Prioritization**: Assign priority levels (low, medium, high) to your tasks.
- **Status Tracking**: Mark tasks as pending or completed to keep track of progress.
- **Due Dates**: Assign due dates to ensure tasks are completed on time.

## Backend Code

The backend code for this application is autogenerated, making it easy to integrate and extend as needed. Since the code is generated based on the database schemas, it may have unknown bugs or errors. The entire class and code structure are designed to be flexible, allowing for further customization if required.

## API Testing

You can test the API using Postman. Access the collection via the following URL:

## Getting Started

To start using the app, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository into your XAMPP `htdocs` directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ygohel18/todo /path/to/xampp/htdocs/todo
    ```

2. **Open Terminal in the Cloned Folder**: Navigate to the cloned directory:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/xampp/htdocs/todo
    ```

3. **Update Dependencies**: Run the following command to update the dependencies using Composer:

    ```bash
    composer update
    ```

4. **Set Up the Database**: Use the `database.sql` file provided in the repository to import the database manually. You can do this via phpMyAdmin or using the MySQL command line:

    - **Using phpMyAdmin**:
      - Open phpMyAdmin in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
      - Import the `database.sql` file into the `todo_app` database.

    - **Using MySQL Command Line**:
      ```bash
      mysql -u your_username -p todo_app < path/to/database.sql
      ```

5. **Configure Database Credentials**: Add your database credentials to the `.htaccess` file in the root of your project:

    ```apache
    SetEnv DB_HOST localhost
    SetEnv DB_USER root
    SetEnv DB_PASSWORD ""
    SetEnv DB_DATABASE todo_app
    ```

6. **Start XAMPP**: Launch XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL services.

7. **Access the App API**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/todo/api/` to access the application.

8. **API Testing**: Use Postman or any other API client to test the application's API endpoints.
